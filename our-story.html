              <p class="card-text"><b>Forest On Cowie</b> forms partnership with <b>Forest Town School</b>, just opposite our newly founded premises â€“ 19 Cowie road, <b>Forest Town</b>. Our mission is that learners from the school will receive the training needed to work and be provided with quality skillsets to use in the real world after school. We aim to inspire each learner to persevere and develop into a person of self-worth and dignity and to instil in each learner a system of values in accordance with our constitution, while providing support to our parents.
              <br><br>
                The TOC department, where the learners will be trained, consist of ten classes. The learners range in ages from 12 to 18 years. The TOC curriculum focuses on six skills as well as academic subjects. These include Sewing, Arts and Crafts, Office Administration, <b>Beauty</b> & <b>Nails</b>, English, Afrikaans, Mathematics and Life Skills. The learners are placed in skills that suit their interest and ability. The educators guide them in their final choices for Year 2, 3 and 4, after experiencing a variety of skills.
                <br><br>
                Our programme aims to support and develop the learner as a whole, including the development of social, emotional, physical and cognitive abilities. Each child has an individual support programme, which caters to their needs on their level, within the curriculum. The learners are engaged in a various creative, sporting and cultural activities during the week. We aim to educate each learner to their maximum potential regardless of the challenges they face on a daily basis.
                <br><br>
                With this being said, <b>Forest on Cowie</b> will provide a space where learners from the program are able to gain real world working experience. This experience can potentially be included in their CV once they leave the school. It will be a space where learners can develop their professional experience, work ethos and specific skills-set in a safe and nurturing environment.</p>
